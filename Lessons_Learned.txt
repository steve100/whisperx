A few quick thoughts for now:

1. Making it look nice is far harder than just running it for yourself
2. WSL instructions added .. and git instructions .. and a setup-folder
3. Used Word for a WhisperS doc
4. Added some small iPhone movies .MOV to have movies to test.
   Added clean-movies-for-testing.sh to make it easier to delete

5. WSL for me is just easier  
   I know the tools / I can find the tools 
   In this case getting Whisper and WhisperX to run on windows proved delaying.

6. Real Ubuntu was faster than WSL 
   Maybe because WSL is ubuntu in a VM.

7. Use case  
   Over the last 3 days I transcribed over 360 minutes (6 hrs) 
   This would be expensive
   Also my videos were too long for ChatGPT.
